      <p id="Hero Background">
        I was born and continued to live in Maria. I have 5 family members. Two
        of them are my younger sisters. My father introduced me to combat at a
        young age and I use to train with him. He was part of the Survey Corps.
        I became a skilled swordsman and I was introduced to the higher ranks of
        the army. I fought in a war that would decide the fate of Paradis,
        against a nation called Marly. After the war was over, I decided to
        spend my time creating artwork and dedicating my life to a career in
        digital technology.

        add value to by displaying such ecstatic artworks. My dream is to become
        a world recognized designer for brands that are well established. With a
        creative imagination and a mind that is dedicated to fulfilling work, I
